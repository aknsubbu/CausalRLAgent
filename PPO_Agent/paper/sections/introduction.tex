Describe your introduction here. It is important to talk about your research area, describe the subject in which you are interested, present the goals of your systematic review, as well as expected contributions for this area of interest. Is there any other known systematic review in this field? If so, why would another one be needed then? What are your specific research questions? According to Wohlin \cite{wohlin-2014}, your introduction should clearly position the paper and help the reader to understand the contribution of the paper and its context.
