In this section, please, introduce the concepts which you are interested in. Present the concepts, with their respective definitions, relevant terminology, alternative interpretations, historical development, so on. Describe all possible related work, known accounts, literature reviews you are aware of, abbreviations, acronyms, and whatever else is useful. Most important of all: make clear what are the knowledge gaps, and the unknowns, that can be addressed by means of your systematic review \cite{theisen-2017}.
