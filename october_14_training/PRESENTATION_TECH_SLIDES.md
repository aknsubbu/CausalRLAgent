# NetHack PPO Agent - Presentation Slides

## 🎯 Slide 1: Model Overview
**NetHack Reinforcement Learning Agent**
- **Algorithm**: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Recurrent Memory
- **Environment**: NetHack roguelike game (complex partial observability)
- **Architecture**: Multi-modal CNN+LSTM with 4.2M parameters
- **Performance**: 37.4% improvement over baseline (112.48 peak reward)

## 🧠 Slide 2: Neural Architecture - Simple Explanation

### **Think of it as a Smart Brain with 5 Senses**
```
NetHack Game → [Multi-Modal Brain] → Decision + Evaluation

The "Brain" has 5 input processors:
👁️  Visual Processor   (CNN+LSTM): Sees the game world  
📊  Stats Processor    (LSTM): Tracks health, level, etc.
💬  Message Processor  (Dense): Understands game text
🎒  Inventory Processor (Dense): Knows what items you have  
🧠  Memory Processor   (Dense): Remembers recent actions
```

### **Two Output "Thoughts"**
- **Actor Network**: "What should I do?" → Action probabilities
- **Critic Network**: "How good is this situation?" → Value score
- **Both share the same understanding** of the game world (shared features)

---

## 📊 Slide 3: How the "Brain" Processes Information

### **Step-by-Step Processing**
```
1. VISUAL (Game Screen) [21×79 pixels]
   → CNN finds patterns (walls, monsters, items) 
   → LSTM remembers "what I saw before"
   → Output: 256 visual features

2. STATS (Your Character) [26 numbers like HP, Level]
   → LSTM tracks "am I getting stronger/weaker?"
   → Output: 64 condition features

3. TEXT + ITEMS + MEMORY [simple processing]
   → Dense networks extract key information
   → Output: 128+64+32 = 224 other features

4. COMBINE EVERYTHING: 256+64+224 = 544 total features
   → Compress to 256 final features that capture EVERYTHING
```

### **Why This Works**
- Like human perception: sight + memory + understanding
- Each processor specializes in one type of information
- Combined understanding drives smart decisions

## ⚙️ Slide 4: Training Configuration

### **Hyperparameters**
```yaml
Learning Rate: 1e-4          Buffer Size: 2048
Clip Ratio: 0.2             Batch Size: 64

- **Optimization**: Adam with gradient clipping
- **Memory**: Episode-reset hidden states
- **Stability**: Entropy regularization + advantage normalization

## 🎯 Slide 5: Reward Engineering

### **Multi-Component Reward Shaping**
```python
Total Reward = Base Game Score + Shaped Components

Shaped Components:
+ Exploration: +0.01 per unique position
+ Health: ±0.001 per HP change  
+ Progression: +1.0 per level up
+ Items: +0.05 per pickup
- Death: -1.0 penalty
- Stuck: -0.01 for position loops
```

### **Anti-Exploitation**
- Position loop detection, Stuck counter penalties
- Exploration incentives, Survival bonuses
