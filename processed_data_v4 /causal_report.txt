💡 Next Steps for Causal Analysis:
   1. Check covariate balance between treatment groups
   2. Estimate propensity scores using confounders
   3. Use matching, IPW, or doubly robust estimation
   4. Estimate ATE/ATT for each treatment variable
   5. Conduct sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding
